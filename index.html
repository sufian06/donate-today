                    <h3>Millions in Bangladesh impacted by one of the worst floodings ever seen</h3>
                    <p>Record-breaking floods in Bangladesh have wreaked havoc as an estimated 7.2 million people have
                        been affected and are in desperate need of shelter and emergency relief items in the
                        north-eastern region of the country.

                        From early in the month of June, torrential rain and upstream water have completely submerged
                        around 94 per cent of the town of Sunamganj and 84 per cent of Sylhet districts, in northeastern
                        Bangladesh, bordering the Meghalaya state of India.

                        Parts of Meghalaya have experienced the highest amount of rainfall in decades, which has led to
                        overflowing of large river systems running between India and Bangladesh and completely
                        swallowing surrounding areas.</p>
